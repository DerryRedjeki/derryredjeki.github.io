## Welcome to my personal website

My name is Derry. **Derry Redjeki** (my alias full name).
If someone already knows my real full name (especially came from LinkedIn as an example), then it's great.
I don't have an intention to hide my real full name, I just don't want anyone to pronounce my real full name more struggle because of my full name. Instead, I create my alias full name to make it easier to read and pronounce as well)

Anyway,
I am a person who is to be self-taught, curious & interesting in learning new things about the video game, Linux open source, hacking, machine learning, cryptocurrency, writing, & programming, although that mostly I am just reading it when I have a free time. But sometimes I took a practice some when needed.
I am a mostly introverted person because I like to work alone & I just don't want to interrupt when I am working on something else, although that communicating with other people is a must when needed in a certain situation.

I am a system administrator who has been experienced for more than 8 years. I have done work for:
- Migrating old server from colocation hosting to the new server private company.
- Creating a task cronjob schedule for a company needed running a business.
- Monitoring & ensuring that the server is running with small downtime (averaging 98%)
- Install & configure package software to optimize a server for developer needed.
- Setup a load balancer server with high-availability mode to make sure that the website is running without interruption
- _(progress...)_

I also can create an email newsletter design as well. I have done work for:
- Design email newsletter more compatible for a specific platform (such as for opening email in Microsoft Outlook, Thunderbird, etc.)
- Reading analytic emails about when the customer will open at a certain time, so I can set schedule an email right on time.

I am currently learning programming Python & DevOps things.

I am currently working on my thesis (master program) about deep learning until now.

And also, I am looking for a job position as a system administrator, DevOps engineering, or penetration tester/ethical hacking. I prefer to do work for remote jobs if available.

Thank you
