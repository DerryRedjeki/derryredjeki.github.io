## Welcome to my personal website

My name is Derry. **Derry Redjeki** (my alias full name).
If someone already know my real full name (especially came from LinkedIn as example), then it's great.
I don't have an intention to hide my real full name, I just don't want anyone to pronounce my real full name more struggle because of my full name. Instead, I create my alias full name to make more easier to read and pronounce as well)

Anyway,
I am the person who is likely to be a self-taught, curious & interested learning new things about the video game, Linux open source, hacking, machine learning, cryptocurrency, writing, & programming, although that mostly I am just reading it when I have a free time. But sometimes I took a practice some when needed.
I am mostly introvert person because I like to work alone & I just don't want to interrupted when I am working something else, although that sometimes

I am system administrator that who have been experienced more than 8 years. I have done work for:
- Migrating old server from colocation hosting to the new server private company.
- Creating a task cronjob schedule for company needed running a business.
- Monitoring & ensuring that server is running with small downtime (averaging 98%)
- Install & configure package software to optimize a server for developer needed.
- Setup a load balancer server with high-availability mode to make sure that website running without interruption
- _(progress...)_

I also can create an email newsletter design as well. I have done work for:
- Design email newsletter more compatible for specific platform (such as for opening email in Microsoft Outlook, Thunderbird, etc.)
- Reading analytic email about when the customer will open in certain time, so I can set schedule an email right on time.

I am currently learning programming Python & devops things.

I am currently working my thesis (master program) about deep learning until now.

And also, I am looking a job position for system administrator, devops engineering or penetration tester/ethical hacking. I prefer to do work for remote jobs if available.

Thank you
